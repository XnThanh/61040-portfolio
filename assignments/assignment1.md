## Domains

1. **Learning Mandarin [selected]:** I love to study foreign languages and I studied Mandarin for roughly 6 years, including 3 trips to Taiwan and roughly a total of 1 year living in Taiwan for the purpose of studying Mandarin. I studied Madarin in all four aspects - listening, speaking, reading, and writing. I started as a complete beginner, with no previous background or exposure to the language. I took classes in high school and throughout college, which taught in Simplified characters and Beijing "standard" accent _(quotations because "standard" is rather subjective)_. In Taiwan, I learned both Simplified and Traditional characters, and while class in Taiwan also speaks the "standard" accent, outside of class, I got lots of exposure to Taiwanese accent and began adapting it.

2. **Managing tasks [selected]:** I am a huge planner and I often like to list down and see all my tasks for the day or upcoming days, which helps me plan how and when to tackle them. I've tried many methods and apps, such as handwriting in an agenda, writing on daily post-its, Notion, Microsoft To Do, digital handwritten notes on tablet, iPhone Notes app, GitHub Tasks, etc. There are time-sensitive tasks, long-term tasks that may sit for a while, and some tasks which I delete after a while (either because I deem them no longer needed or a deadline passed).

3. **Tracking Exercise for Powerlifters [selected]:** I powerlift but I do a bad job of remembering my max lifts (particularly for doubles, I usually don't forget my 1-rep max). I like to track what I do in my workouts since they are somewhat dependent on previous workouts and which lifts I succeeded at which weight, especially as I build up for a PR (Personal Record) day. I have used 5x5 Stronglifts app, writing down on iPhone Notes app, and Google Spreadsheet. However, none of them lasted for very long (I get lazy to fill them out or they not are suitable for logging certain workouts since they were set up for a very specific type of workout (particularly 5x5 Stronglifts)). I have also used other non-lifting exercise tracking apps like Strava.

4. **Managing Time:** I like to plan out my entire day so that every hour of my day has a job (i.e. scheduled to be doing something, which can be work, hobby, or relaxing). My current system is a mixture of Google Calendar on laptop and phone, and handwritten planning on my tablet.

5. **Technology Use:** Aside from work-related matters, I also spend time on my phone and surfing the web on my laptop. I've used different methods to make me more aware of, and also reduce my technology use, such as wrapping a hair elastic on my phone, phone detox, and apps such as Apple Screen Time and Opal.

6. **Managing Inventory:** I like to know everything I have and where they are because I move around (to other cities/countries) rather often. It helps a lot with packing for a mid- or long-term move and keeps me from buying something I already have. It also makes for a much easier time finding things when I need them. I currently have a google spreadsheet that tracks (~70% of) my stuff and their location.

7. **Career Management:** I spend a lot of time looking for internships and applying to them, and currently track my job search via a google spreadsheet.

8. **Wellbeing:** I have a habit of wanting to form new habits and then a habit of never actually doing it.

9. **Budgeting:** I travel a lot and always keep track of my spending.

10. **Reading:** I like to read personal development books and always looking for new (exciting) books to read. Though I also have a habit addings books to my reading list way faster than I remove them from my reading list via reading them.

## Problems

**Learning Mandarin**

1. Zhuyin Typing: Zhuyin is an input method for typing traditional chinese characters used in Taiwan. It takes a lot of practice to be able to type with it at a reasonable speed, as someone who did not use Zhuyin from a young age. However, there is no good Zhuyin Typing practice online (similar to how you can practice typing and improve speed on sites like Typing.com).

   **[selected]** This is a solvable problem as typing speed increases with practice, and there are solutions to this (i.e. typing practice websites) that just needs to be adapted to support Zhuyin. There is also a user base for this - young children learning to type, and Mandarin learners who want to use Zhuyin typing system.

2. Character Recognition: As a foreign language learner of Mandarin, I often have problems differentiating very similar characters, such as:

   - 已 / 己,
   - 末 / 未,
   - 环 / 坏,
   - 辦 / 辯,
   - 师 / 帅

   Native speakers are able to differentiate these characters easily through years of primary and secondary education, where teachers will highlight these differences. Chinese (as a foreign language) teachers don't always highlight these differences to students, and when they do, it is often just said to a student once in their entire Chinese learning journey, which students may not always remember due to all the challenges involved in learning a new language, and many new things being thrown at them.

   **[selected]** It is a unique and niche problem that I personally care about, and can be very helpful to advanced Mandarin learners. It's not over-ambitous as it targets a very specific part of learning Mandarin that is a pain point for many learners.

3. Pronounciation: I have a Vietnamese accent when I speak Mandarin. However, my teachers in Taiwan have helped me improve my pronounciation a lot by telling me what I am doing wrong and how to fix it. For example, they might tell me to push the air to the front more than the back of my mouth, or to move my tongue and mouth to a certain position.

   **[not selected]** This is a very hard problem to solve. My teachers have had decades of experience and education in teaching chinese as a foreign language, and can therefore determine where the issue with my pronounciation is. However, creating a software that can detect this and find the correct adjustment for the student seems like a PhD research project.

**Managing Tasks**

1. No single source of truth: I use different methods for tracking my tasks, some online (notes app, tablet), some offline (post it notes), and therefore it can get confusing when I'm referencing multiple places for my to do and tasks list.

   **[not selected]** Seems more like an issue with my own habits and consistency than it is with availability of suitable software.

2. Lack of task categorization: Some tasks have deadlines, some don't. Some tasks have not been started on, some are in progress, and some are done. My current tasks management system are mostly via handwritten methods (online and offline) so I only have the option to mark a task as done (crossed out) or not done. As for deadlines, I usually keep track of them in my head or sometimes write it down, but I would like something that automatically brings my tasks with nearing deadlines to the top.

   **[selected]** It could be a cross between Github taskboard and Microsoft Todo. Provides enough differentiation since it is merging useful features of different softwares together.

3. Time Allocation: Often times, I underestimate how long problem sets and activites would take. As a result, my hours become limited and the remaining items on the list become deproritized, causing me to falll behind schedule.

   **[not selected]** Friction. To predict time it takes to complete a task requires historical data from the user, which means users would need to input the data before the app can be useful.

**Tracking Exercise**

1. Different apps for different exercises: I mainly lift, but sometimes I run or do other types of exercise. However, many workout tracking apps do not have a good run tracker, as they are made for gym workouts. On the flip side, run trackers like Strava are not the best for workout tracking (no easy way to add exercises done with reps, sets, and weight).

   **[not selected]** Over ambitous. Would require the app to excel at tracking many different types of exercises. Strava is popular in the running community because it was tailored to runners and their needs. Stronglifts 5x5 is tailored specifically to that lifting program. An app that tailors tracking to all forms of exercises would be great, but hard to execute well.

2. No tracking of non 1-rep max lifts: A lot of weight lifting trackers shows you a graph of your one-rep max progression, but I also care about my 2-rep maxes for training purposes. I don't necessarily need a graph but I would like to easily see what my current 2-rep max is for a particular lift.

   **[not selected]** Lack of critical mass and indifference. Very few users will direly need this functionality. Many powerlifters just look back in their notebook or workout tracker to the last time they did a 2-rep max.

3. Organization: Sometimes, I would like to look at what I did on a particular date, sometimes years back. Other times, I would like to see how I programmed a particular exercise, or a particular portion of my training cycle. This would require filtering by dates or exercises, which none of my current tracking methods have a good/visually appealing way of doing.

   **[not selected]** Insufficient differentiation. Probably all workout trackers are ordered by date, so a date filter won't save much more time than scrolling back. Many workout trackers have a search function (Ctrl+F in google sheets for a particular exercise might not be the best UI for filtering exercise, but it does the job).

## Stakeholders

**Zhuyin Typing**

- Taiwanese children: elementary and middle school-aged children in Taiwan who are learning to type.

- Foreign learners: Mandarin learners (foreigners or non-advanced heritage speakers) who want to learn Zhuyin for typing Chinese. They often have issues with remembering tones.

- Heritage learners: native or advanced heritage Chinese speakers who are learning Zhuyin, either because they grew up knowing another input system such as Pinyin, or never learned to write/type. They don't have problems with remembering tones.

- Teachers: teachers of the above three stakeholders

- Taiwanese: native Taiwanese or those of Taiwanese heritage

Taiwanese children, foreign learners, heritage learners all suffer from lack of Zhuyin typing practice. Teachers may have interest in providing resources that can help their students learn and practice in their own time. Taiwanese may have interest in spreading their culture and language as Zhuyin is used solely in Taiwan and by Taiwanese outside Taiwan; besides writing traditional characters, Zhuyin plays a role in Taiwanese pop culture, as many slangs, puns, and trends, along with some references to Taiwanese Hokkien (another language spoken in Taiwan) stems from Zhuyin.

**Character Recognition**

- Young native-speakers: elementary and middle school-aged children in Chinese-speaking countries who are still learning chinese vocabulary and new characters.

- Foreign learners: Mandarin learners who are learning the pronounciation, writing, and meaning of a character all at the same time.

- Heritage learners: those of Chinese heritage who can speak but not write

- Native speaker: native Mandarin speakers

- App developers: someone who develops apps or build learning tools

- Curriculum designers: someone who designs educational curriculums

Young native speaker, foreign learners, and heritage learners suffers from lack of consolidated resource that contains all similar-looking characters and being able to drill them. Native speakers suffers from learners making mistakes when reading, leading to misunderstanding or needing to correct learner. App developers may have interest in adding learning features to their platform. Curriculum designers may have interest in improving similar-character recognition in students.

**Lack of task categorization**

- Students: someone who needs to manage homework, campus jobs, meetings, clubs, and personal deadlines

- Working professionals: someone who needs to manage deadlines of projects and work

- Friends and family: someone who interacts with students and working professionals socially and personally

- Collaborators: someone who works on shared tasks with students or working professionals

Students and working professionals suffers from a variety of consequences if they miss deadlines. Friends and family suffer from having less time with, or having to deal with a stressed friend or family member. Collaborator suffer from inconvenience of their collaborator not managing their time well and affecting group productivity.
