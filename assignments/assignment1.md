# Assignment 1

## Domains

1. **Learning Mandarin [selected]:** I love to study foreign languages and I studied Mandarin for roughly 6 years, including 3 trips to Taiwan and roughly a total of 1 year living in Taiwan for the purpose of studying Mandarin. I studied Madarin in all four aspects - listening, speaking, reading, and writing. I started as a complete beginner, with no previous background or exposure to the language. I took classes in high school and throughout college, which taught in Simplified characters and Beijing "standard" accent _(quotations because "standard" is rather subjective)_. In Taiwan, I learned both Simplified and Traditional characters, and while class in Taiwan also speaks the "standard" accent, outside of class, I got lots of exposure to Taiwanese accent and began adapting it.

2. **Managing tasks [selected]:** I am a huge planner and I often like to list down and see all my tasks for the day or upcoming days, which helps me plan how and when to tackle them. I've tried many methods and apps, such as handwriting in an agenda, writing on daily post-its, Notion, Microsoft To Do, digital handwritten notes on tablet, iPhone Notes app, GitHub Tasks, etc. There are time-sensitive tasks, long-term tasks that may sit for a while, and some tasks which I delete after a while (either because I deem them no longer needed or a deadline passed).

3. **Tracking Exercise [selected]:** I powerlift but I do a bad job of remembering my max lifts (particularly for doubles, I usually don't forget my 1-rep max). I like to track what I do in my workouts since they are somewhat dependent on previous workouts and which lifts I succeeded at which weight, especially as I build up for a PR (Personal Record) day. I have used 5x5 Stronglifts app, writing down on iPhone Notes app, and Google Spreadsheet. However, none of them lasted for very long.

4. **Managing Time:** I like to plan out my entire day so that every hour of my day has a job (i.e. scheduled to be doing something, which can be work, hobby, or relaxing). My current system is a mixture of Google Calendar on laptop and phone, and handwritten planning on my tablet.

5. **Technology Use:** Aside from work-related matters, I also spend time on my phone and surfing the web on my laptop. I've used different methods to make me more aware of, and also reduce my technology use, such as wrapping a hair elastic on my phone, phone detox, and apps such as Apple Screen Time and Opal.

6. **Managing Inventory:** I like to know everything I have and where they are because I move around (to other cities/countries) rather often. It helps a lot with packing for a mid- or long-term move and keeps me from buying something I already have. It also makes for a much easier time finding things when I need them. I currently have a google spreadsheet that tracks (~70% of) my stuff and their location.

7. **Career Management:** I spend a lot of time looking for internships and applying to them, and currently track my job search via a google spreadsheet.

8. **Wellbeing:** I have a habit of wanting to form new habits and then a habit of never actually doing it.

9. **Budgeting:** I travel a lot and always keep track of my spending.

10. **Reading:** I like to read personal development books and always looking for new (exciting) books to read. Though I also have a habit addings books to my reading list way faster than I remove them from my reading list via reading them.
