## About Me

My name is Xuan Ly. I'm a senior in 6-3.

Some fun facts about me:

1. I powerlift and competed once in Taiwan.
2. I took a [gap year in Taiwan](https://iclp.ntu.edu.tw/) last year to study Mandarin full time.
3. I like woodworking and glassblowing.

Here is an online photo of my favorite city, Taipei:
